The Offer is not subject to the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz) (“WpÜG”). Thus, neither the WpÜG nor the German Regulation on the Content of the Offer Document, the Consideration for Takeover Offers and Mandatory Offers and the Release from the Ob- ligation to Publish and Launch an Offer (Verordnung Ober den lnhalt der Angebotsunterlage, die Gegenleistung bei Ubernahmeangeboten und Pflichtangeboten und die Befreiung von der Verpflichtung zur Veroffentlichung und zur Abgabe eines Angebots, WpÜG-AV) are ap- plicable to the Offer. Accordingly, this Offer has neither been submitted to BaFin (or any other supervisory authority) for review and approval nor for inspection and does not comply with the provisions of the WpÜG. With this Offer, the Company is not carrying out a public offer according to any laws other than those of Germany with consideration of certain provisions of the United States. No registrations, admissions or approvals of this Offer Document and/or Offer outside of Ger- many have been filed, arranged for or granted. The Bidder therefore does not assume any responsibility for compliance with law other than the laws of Germany and the United States. 1.2 Publication of the Offer Document This Offer Document will be published on the website at the internet address https://inves- tors.vodafone.com/individual-shareholders/KDG-offer. Apart from this publication, no further publication or distribution of the Offer Document is intended. 1.3 Distribution and Acceptance of the Offer outside the Federal Republic of Germany The publication of the Offer Document by the Bidder is exclusively based on the laws of Germany and German market practice. A publication under the laws of any other jurisdiction than of Germany or the United States has not occurred and is neither intended nor permitted by the Company. Any such non-permitted publication, dispatching, distribution or dissemina- tion of the Offer Document may be subject to the provisions (particularly restrictions) of for- eign Jurisdictions. This also applies to any summary or other description of the terms and conditions contained in the Offer Document. The Company has not approved the publication, dispatch, distribution or dissemination of this Offer Document or other documents associated with the Offer by third parties outside Germany and the United States. The Offer is not, whether directly or indirectly, made in any other jurisdiction where the Offer would be contrary to law or regulation or would require any registration or licensing within 1

Section 7.2 of this Offer Document) for distribution to KDG Shareholders residing in Germany and the United States only.

The Bidder, its affiliates, their advisors, and the nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, KDG Shares outside the Offer, such as in open market purchases or privately negotiated purchases, during the period in which the Offer remains open for acceptance. If such purchases or arrangements to pur- chase were to be made, they would be made outside the United States and would comply with applicable law, including German laws and the Exchange Act. Any such purchases by the Bidder or its affiliates will not be made at prices higher than the price of the Offer provided 2

However, the costs for submitting the Declaration of Ac- ceptance to the Custodian Bank will not be reimbursed. Any costs charged by other Custodian Banks or intermediate custodians outside Germany will be borne by each accepting KDG Shareholder. In addition, any taxes levied in connection with the conclusion of the pur- chase agreement or the transfer of the Tendered KDG Shares, against payment of the Offer Consideration, will be paid by the accepting KDG Shareholder.

Should the Completion Condition pursuant to Section 9.1 of this Offer Document have not yet been fulfilled or validly waived at the time when the Acceptance Period expires, there may be a delay in the Offer’s settle- ment and crediting of the Offer Consideration for the Tendered KDG Shares. In such case, the Offer’s settlement and crediting of the Offer Consideration for the Tendered KDG Shares will be effected without un- due delay, however, not later than seven banking days after the publica- tion of the fulfilment of the Completion Condition pursuant to Section 9.4 of this Offer Document. In the event of the latest possible fulfilment of the Completion Condition set out in Section 9.1 of this Offer Document, i.e. on 30 June 2021, the settlement of the Offer and the payment of the Offer Consideration for the Tendered KDG Shares can be delayed until 9 July 2021.

Should the Completion Condition pursuant to Section 9.1 of this Offer Document have not yet been fulfilled or validly waived at the time when the Acceptance Period expires, there may be a delay in the Offer’s settlement and crediting of the Offer Consideration for the Tendered KDG Shares. In such case, the Offer’s settlement and crediting of the Offer Con- sideration for the Tendered KDG Shares will be effected without undue delay, however, not later than seven banking days after the publication of the fulfilment of the Completion Con- dition pursuant to Section 9.4 of this Offer Document.

For this purpose, the Bidder shall grant to the Custodian Banks a compensation payment of which they shall be separately notified and which includes a custodian bank commission customary in the market. Costs imposed by other Custodian Banks or foreign intermediate custodians shall be borne by each accepting KDG Shareholder. 12

Therefore, KDG Shareholders cannot trade Tendered KDG Shares on the regulated market of any stock exchange or over the counter market, irrespective of whether the Tendered KDG Shares are sold to the Bidder on the basis of this Offer or are later returned. 8 Official approvals Assuming a “hard” Brexit (i.e. without any specific arrangements in relation to investments by investors based in the United Kingdom) at the end of the current transition period as agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom which is expected to end on 31 December 2020, the acquisition of the KDG Shares by the Bidder pursuant to this Offer requires the foreign investment control clearance for acquisitions from 1 January 2021 on- wards as described below. The acquisition of a domestic (i.e. German) company or of a direct or indirect stake of more than 10% or 25% of the voting rights respectively in such a company by a resident from outside of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association – inter alia by means of a tender offer or share purchase agreement – may be subject to a foreign investment review by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, the “BMWi”) pursuant to section 55 et seqq. of the German For- eign Trade and Payments Ordinance (Aussenwirtschaftsverordnung, “AWV”). In such review, the BMWi will assess whether the acquisition is likely to adversely affect the public order or security of the Federal Republic of Germany or of other EU Member States or certain Union projects and programs which are specified on a regular basis in further communications from the European Commission (cf. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1298 of 13 July 2020). The threshold of 10% of the voting rights applies where the target company operates within the list of industry sectors that are considered to be particularly significant to public order or security (section 55 para. 1 sentence 2 AWV). In this event, the conclusion of the relevant agreement has to be notified to the BMWi (section 55 para. 4 sentence 1 AWV). The acquisition of the shares in KDG AG pursuant to the Offer (the “Transaction”) transac- tion involves the acquisition of an indirect shareholding of more than 10% and 25% respec- tively of the voting rights in a German company by an investor from outside the European Union or the European Free Trade Association and is therefore subject to the German reg- ulations on the control of foreign investments pursuant to sections 55 et seq. AWV. As KDG AG operates critical infrastructure in the telecommunications sector within the meaning of section 55 para. 1 sentence 2 no. 1 AWV in connection with section 5 Ordinance for the De- termination of Critical Infrastructure pursuant (“KritisV”) KDG AG is under the obligation to notify the transaction to the BMWi. In order to fulfil the notification obligation of the Bidder under section 55 para. 4 AWV, the Bidder may apply for a clearance certificate within the meaning of 58 para. 1 AWV (Un- bedenklichkeitsbescheinigung, the “Clearance Certificate”). Within two months following 13

– Convenience Translation – the submission of the application, the BMWi may (i) issue the Clearance Certification if it concludes that the transaction does not raise concerns with respect to the public order or security of the Federal Republic of Germany or (ii) initiate a formal investigation and request further information. Should the BMWi not take any action during this two-month period, the Clearance Certificate is deemed to be granted. If the BMWi initiates a formal investigation within the two-month period, an acquirer is under the obligation to submit certain information pursuant to a general ruling of the BMWi as well as any additional documents and information the BMWi may request. The BMWi will then have four months after receipt of the complete set of documents to decide whether to clear the transaction, to prohibit it or to issue orders to ensure public order or security of the Fed- eral Republic of Germany (section 59 para. 1 AWV). In exceptionally complex cases, the BMWi may extend the four-month period by another three months. Additionally, with the con- sent of the immediate acquirer the review period can be further extended. BMWi and the parties to a transaction may also enter into a public law contractual agreement to guarantee public order or security; in such case the four months deadline is suspended for the duration of respective negotiations between the BMWi and the parties (section 14a para. 6 no. 2 of the German Foreign Trade Act (Aussenwirtschaftsgesetz; “AWG”)). Furthermore, the BMWi has to notify all other Member States and the European Commission of all foreign investments it scrutinises and has to provide certain information on the parties and the transaction. The Member States may submit comments within 35 days (and 20 fur- ther days if Member State(s) request additional information); the European Commission has – compared to Member States – an additional five days. The Bidder intends to file an application for a Clearance Certificate pursuant to section 58 para. 1 AWV. 9 Prerequisites for the completion of the Offer 9.1 Completion Condition / foreign investment control clearance The Offer and the agreements with the KDG Shareholders which came into existence as a result of the acceptance of the Offer will only be completed if between the publication of this Offer Document and by 30 June 2021 the BMWi either has (a) declared that no right to review the Transaction pursuant to foreign investment legislation applies or (b) issued the Clearance Certificate upon application of the Bidder or (c) within two months after receipt of the due application for a Clearance Certificate neither issued such Clearance Certificate nor initiated formal investigations or (d), in the event of formal investigations, within the periods specified in section 14a AWG, either unconditionally or on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Bidder cleared or failed to prohibit the transaction (“Completion Condition”). 9.2 Waiver of Completion Condition The Bidder reserves the right to waive – to the extent legally permissible – the Completion Condition.

KDG Shares already tendered will be retransferred. Accordingly, the Custodian Banks will have to arrange for the Tendered KDG Shares to be re-booked into ISIN DE000KD88880 without undue delay, but at the latest within five banking days after announcement of the lapse of the Offer. The reversal shall be free of costs and expenses of Custodian Banks in accordance with Section 7.6 of this Offer Document. 9.4 Publication of the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of the Completion Condition If the Completion Condition has been fulfilled or validly waived, or the Offer will not be com- pleted, the Bidder will publish this fact without undue delay on the internet at https://inves- tors.vodafone.com/individual-shareholders/KDG-offer (in English and German language). 10 Financing The Bidder and its Affiliates have the financial means to fulfil the Offer in full at the time the Offer Consideration becomes due and payable. 11 Taxes The Bidder recommends KDG Shareholders to seek tax advice with regard to the tax con- sequences of an acceptance of this Offer, in particular taking into account their personal financial circumstances, before accepting the Offer. 12 Governing law and place of jurisdiction This Offer and the agreements coming into existence with the Bidder as a result of the ac- ceptance of this Offer shall be governed by German law. The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all legal disputes arising out of, or in connection with, this Offer (and any agreements which are entered into as a result of the acceptance of this Offer) shall, to the extent legally permissible, be Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
